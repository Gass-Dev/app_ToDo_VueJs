# app_ToDo_VueJs

By using vue (without other librairies), build a todo app allowing a user to:

- Display tasks
- Create a task
- Edit a task
- Mark a task as done
- Delete a task
- User can see when a task is created, and a task is done

1- Install VueJs
    -> npm install -g @vue/cli
2- Create a project
    -> vue create my-project
3- Get started:
    -> cd todo
    -> npm run serve
